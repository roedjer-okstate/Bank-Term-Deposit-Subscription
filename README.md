# Mini-Project-2---BAN-5753: Bank Term Deposit Subscription

## Executive Summary
In this project, we developed a predictive model to identify potential clients likely to subscribe to a bank's term deposit plan. Our comprehensive approach included:

- **Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We delved into the data to understand key factors influencing client decisions. Insights revealed that clients in the 30-50 age group, those with higher educational backgrounds, and those without a history of credit default were more inclined to invest in term deposits.

- **Development of Various Machine Learning Models:** We employed models like Logistic Regression for baseline performance, Decision Trees, Random Forests for feature importance understanding, and Gradient Boosting Machines for higher accuracy.

- **Performance Comparison of Models:** Our evaluation focused on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, leading us to identify the most effective model for our objectives.

Based on our findings, we recommend the bank to:
1. **Target Specific Demographics:** Focus marketing efforts on clients aged 30-50 and those with a higher educational background.
2. **Customize Communication:** Tailor marketing messages to highlight security and benefits of term deposits, appealing to clients with no credit default history.
3. **Leverage Data Insights for Campaigns:** Utilize model predictions to refine and focus marketing campaigns, potentially increasing conversion rates.

These strategies are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the bank's marketing campaigns, leveraging data-driven insights to achieve better client engagement and subscription rates.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Overview
The EDA phase was pivotal in understanding the dataset. It involved detailed analysis of various factors that might influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit.

### Key Activities
- Identification and analysis of 'Unknown' categories in the dataset to detect data inconsistencies.
- Examination of the distribution of credit default among clients, revealing potential risk factors.
- Construction of a correlation matrix to explore how different variables interact with each other.
- Analysis of client demographics, focusing on education and job types, to understand the target market.
- Investigation of the effectiveness of call strategies based on different weekdays.

## Modeling
### Process
Modeling was a critical phase where we applied various algorithms to predict client subscriptions.

### Steps Involved
- Preprocessing data to ensure it is suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Experimenting with diverse models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Hyperparameter tuning for enhancing model performance.

## Model Comparison
### Approach
We systematically compared the models to select the most effective one.

### Comparison Criteria
- Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each model.
- Selecting the optimal model based on a balance of all performance indicators.

## Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we suggested several strategies for the bank to refine its marketing approaches, targeting potential subscribers more effectively.

## Conclusion
Our project culminated in valuable insights, highlighting the significance of data-driven strategies in marketing. We provided a comprehensive overview of our findings and their implications for future marketing campaigns.
